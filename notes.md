Now I need to work on creating PGP Key for user and assign it in database

TODO:

1. PGP Form validation when user, enters the PGP key and when storing in the database
   (How should I protect the input, how should i store the PGP key into the database what library should I use and etc)

2. CHATTING FUNCTIONALITY after complete PGP functionality (between users)

DOCKER: I can try to host the application on onion and try to test the application

give me a component that allows user to have decentralized communication channel with E2E encryption, there can be later servers-like or more like group chats and basically channels like IRC and forums for user to discuss anything. Also of course there should be Direct Messages between the users

Example of chat component: <https://v0.dev/chat/decentralized-chat-platform-M8TWUSTLj6A>

⚠️ Important:
You are the only one with access to your private key.
If you lose your key or forget your passphrase, your messages cannot be recovered.
This is a privacy feature — not even we can help you regain access

Building Chat functionality:

Show all of the users in the general channel
Implement sending messages to the server and storing
them in database.
